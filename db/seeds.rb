# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# user = User.create(
# 	f_name: "namrata",
# 	l_name: "gupta",
# 	rank: "1"
# )
# 20.times do |i|
# 	puts "creating users #{i+1}"
# 	User.create(
# 			f_name: "User#{i+1}",
# 			l_name: "Lname#{i+1}",
# 			rank: "User#{i+1}"
# 		)
